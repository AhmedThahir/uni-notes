# Time Preferences

Most non-trivial economic choices involve 

1. Determine tradeoffs between costs and benefits that occur **across time points**
2. Determine values (utility) of costs and benefits, by weighing costs & benefits against each other

## Present Bias

Humans have a tendency to put more weight into the present rather than the future when making decision

## Utility Function

$$
\begin{aligned}
\max U_t &= \sum_{t = 0}^\infty D(t) \cdot u_{t_0 + t} \\
u_t &= u(c_t, l_t, \dots)
\end{aligned}
$$

| $U_t$     | Discounted utility    | Captures total utility obtained until a specific moment      |                        |

### Estimating $\delta$

Ask the person the following question

> What $X$ makes you indifferent between receiving `$15` today and `$X` at various time point $t$
>
> - $t=1$ day
> - $t=1$ month
> - $t=1$ year

Assumes that utility is linear in money, ie marginal utility is constant, ie $u(X) = X$

## IDK

### Short vs Long-Run Impatience

People tend to be more patient in the long-run than in the short-run

Eg: Credit card loans

### Preference Reversals

In reality, dynamic consistency is **not** followed. People don’t always follow through with their plans.

Hence

- When thinking ahead to the future, we **want** to be patient
- When the time actually comes, we are impatient
- People are over-confident about their self-control

Eg: Dieting, Gym membership

#### Dynamic/Time Consistency

- The action a person thinks they should take in the future always coincides with the action that they actually prefer to take once the time comes
- A person’s preferences at different points in time are consistent with each other; there are no “intra-personal conflicts” 

### Commitment Devices

Arrangement taken upon by agent to restrict their future choice set, by making certain choices more costly

Demand for commitment requests (at least partial) sophistication

When you know that your future preferences will be different from present preferences, you may engage in commitment devices to penalize (and hence eliminate) few options from the future. We disapprove of the tendency for instant gratification beforehand, but struggle to actually follow through

### Requirements for effectiveness of commitment device

- Person needs to have a self-control problem: $\beta < 1$
- Person needs to at least partly be sophisticated: $\hat \beta < 1$
- Commitment devices needs to be effective
- Person needs to believe that the commitment device is effective

### Things that worsen effectiveness of commitment devices

- Time-inconsistent preferences: Each time period’s self restrict set of choices for their future selves, and hence there may be difference in assessment of best action at each time period
- Substitution: Substitution across temptation goods worsens effectiveness of commitment devices. Avoiding one temptation good may lead to increases consumption of another
- Naivete: Person underestimates their present bias, and might
  - Naive: Not demand a helpful commitment device
  - Partial naive: Demand a unhelpful commitment device

## Utility Evaluation

### Example

Consider the following table showing the utilities associated with watching a movie

![image-20240212122705997](assets/image-20240212122705997.png)

|                    | Naïveté                                                      | Sophistication                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Utility Evaluation | t=0: Plans to go at t=3, so doesn’t go<br />t=1: Plans to go at t=3, so doesn’t go<br />t=2: Goes | t=2: goes if she hasn’t<br />t=1: realizes she won’t wait until t=3, she goes<br />t=0: realizes she won’t wait until t=2 or 3, she goes |
| Conclusion         | Goes at t=2, even though she planned to go at t=3            | Just goes at t=0                                             |

## Indicators of Behavior Types

- Naivete: Person mis-predicting future behavior
- Sophistication: Person’s use of commitment devices

## Uncertainties about Future

- Present bias
- Planning Fallacy

## Planning Fallacy

 Cognitive bias where people underestimate the time, resources, and effort needed to complete a task, even when they have experience with similar tasks that took longer than planned

## Case Studies

### Assignment Deadlines

Order of effectiveness

1. Imposed deadlines
2. Self-imposed assignments
3. no deadline for assignments

### Gym Membership Purchase



### Work

Dominated contract increases production

### Credit Card Companies

Consider 3 types of loans with the following interest rates for different duration of loans

| Deal              | < 6M | >= 6M |
| ----------------- | ---- | ----- |
| Standard          | 10%  | 20%   |
| Teaser Offer      | 5%   | 20%   |
| Post-Teaser Offer | 10%  | 15%   |

Why would more people choose the teaser offer?

- Naive borrows believe they will repay loan quickly
  - They borrow more than expected
- Sophisticated borrowers don’t want to use their cards in the future, so choose high future interest rate to restrain future borrowing
  - Expensive commitment device
  - Substitution to other credit cards would undo this strategy

How do credit card companies use this info

- Identify who are naive and who are sophisticated
- Credit card companies want to exploit people until the point that they won’t default
- Naive households are more likely to be offered hidden-fee structures
  - Low introductory/teaser rates
  - Photos, colors, fine print
  - After introductory period, these cards feature higher interest rates, late fees and over-limit fees

### Gym Membership Sale

Similar to above, the gyms want to entice customers with cheap short-term fees but want to retain customers in the long-run as well

### Commitment Savings

| Treatment |                   | Commitment offer:<br />Restrict access to deposits |
| --------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| SEED      | Encourage to save | ✅                                                  |
| Marketing | Encourage to save | ❌                                                  |
| Control   | None              | None                                               |

- Offering commitment savings significant increased savings
- People still default on commitment contract

### Alcohol consumption

Low-income workers tend to drink a lot of alcohol

Many say that

- They would like to reduce drinking
- They would happier if liquor stores closed

Physical pain from work appears to contribute to self-control problems

- Alcohol is powerful anesthetic
- Pain increases short-run benefits of drinking while leaving long-run costs unaffected

They can’t just ‘stop drinking’ as they will face severe withdrawal syndromes



- Sobriety incentives reduce day drinking
- Individuals mostly substitute to night drinking
- No impact of incentives on labor-market outcomes
- Increased savings

### Smoking



### Farmers Fertilizers

Give option to Pre-buy fertilizer at time of harvest, much before time of sowing

Time of sowing = when fertilizer needed



Compared to discount at time of sowing

- More effective at getting farmers to purchase
- Expensive to give subsidies
- Subsidies will get wasted on everyone
- Subsidies may incentivize some to over-use fertilizers
